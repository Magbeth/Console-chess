Console chess game

Logic for pieces and board displaying developed.

TODO:
 - ADD Castle and checking possibility for it (king cant go through attacked squares)
 - FIX bug with Pawn (now it can move back)
 - ADD check for check and checkmate
 - ADD check for King moves to not move on attacked square
 
 (Attacked square - square on which some enemy piece can move on)
